kiwi for Debian
--------------

The kiwi Debian package intentionally does not ship the 'kiwicompat' command as this is just
a wrapper around 'kiwi-ng'. 'kiwicompat' is intended to provide the command line syntax of the
'kiwi' command of the legacy kiwi package that was never part of Debian. Upstream is planning
to remove the 'kiwicompat' command in the near future.
